I was mentioned in Val Town's [Restricted Library Mode](https://blog.val.town/blog/restricted-library-mode) blog after reporting a series of critical security vunerabilities in their JavaScript runtime.

> If you are familiar with the challenges of [sandboxing user code](https://healeycodes.com/sandboxing-javascript-code), you might realize that we set ourselves a herculean task: keeping user secrets sandboxed while also allowing them to pass arbitrarily rich computational objects between each other. After playing and losing this cat-and-mouse game with the fantastic exploit-finder Andrew Healey one too many times, we decided to admit defeat and race to a more securable semantics ASAP. Specifically, we needed semantics that allowed for process isolation and serialization between all user code.

I'm really happy with how they responded to the issues I raised â€“ and I continue to think it's a neat platform!
