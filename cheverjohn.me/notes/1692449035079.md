I added a few features to my [nodots programming language](https://github.com/healeycodes/nodots-lang) (it's just a little tree-walk interpreter, nothing fancy).

These PRs were fun to implement. They're a little hacky.

- Add dicts and lists [#2](https://github.com/healeycodes/nodots-lang/pull/2)

- Add REPL [#4](https://github.com/healeycodes/nodots-lang/pull/4)
